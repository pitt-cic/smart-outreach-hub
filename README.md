# Overview

Smart Outreach Hub is an **intelligent AI-driven SMS marketing platform** designed to transform customer engagement through personalized, automated messaging. The solution leverages modern large language models (LLMs) to drive meaningful conversations, engage with prospects, and guide them toward purchase decisions and/or philanthropic contributions.

This project was initiated in response to a real-world challenge faced by the University of Pittsburgh's Athletics department, which sought to enhance its outreach efforts to potential ticket buyers, alumni, and donors. By harnessing the power of AI, Smart Outreach Hub aims to streamline communication processes, improve response rates, and ultimately boost revenue generation through targeted SMS campaigns.

The platform delivers a comprehensive suite of features, including campaign management, real-time customer response handling, AI-powered automated replies, intelligent routing to human agents, and campaign analytics.

**_While built for Pitt Athletics, the solution is designed to be adaptable for any organization requiring automated SMS outreach with human oversight. The AI agent's behavior can be customized through prompt engineering to match different use cases, industries, and communication styles._**

# Description

## Problem Statement
Pitt Athletics faced a significant challenge in scaling their fan engagement efforts due to limited capacity of their sales team. Despite having a large database of potential leads including fans and alumni interested in purchasing tickets or making philanthropic contributions, the department lacks the automated outreach capabilities needed to effectively engage this audience at scale. The existing systems provide robust data management but cannot facilitate the automated, personalized initial contact and qualification processes necessary to reach thousands of potential supporters. This resource constraint leaves many potential leads unengaged, creating a significant gap in their outreach strategy and revenue opportunities. An automated AI-driven solution would bridge this gap, enabling the department to efficiently connect with a broader audience while still maintaining meaningful, personalized interactions.

## Our Approach

Smart Outreach Hub addresses these challenges through an intelligent, scalable SMS engagement platform that combines AI-driven conversation management with human oversight. The solution automates initial outreach and qualification while maintaining the personalized touch that makes customer interactions meaningful.

**Agentic AI Workflow**: At the core of the system is an agentic AI workflow powered by Claude Sonnet 4 via Amazon Bedrock, integrated using Pydantic AI. When customers respond to campaigns, messages are validated, stored in Amazon DynamoDB, and processed through the AI agent which maintains conversation history to provide contextually relevant responses. The agent follows carefully designed prompts that embody the personality of a sales representative. Built-in guardrails ensure appropriate interactions, and the system intelligently determines when conversations should be escalated to human sales representatives based on purchase intent, information needs, or explicit customer requests.

**Serverless Event-Driven Architecture**: The platform leverages a fully serverless, event-driven architecture built on AWS services including Lambda, SQS, SNS, DynamoDB, and AWS End User Messaging. Outbound campaigns are queued via SQS and processed through dedicated Lambda functions that handle SMS delivery, while inbound messages flow through SNS topics to SQS queues that trigger the agentic AI workflow. This architecture provides automatic scaling to handle thousands of concurrent conversations, eliminates server management overhead, and ensures cost-efficient operation by charging only for actual usage. The decoupled nature of the event-driven design allows each component to scale independently based on demand.

**Modern User Interface**: The web interface provides sales teams with comprehensive campaign management capabilities including prospect list uploads via CSV, campaign creation and editing, and real-time delivery of campaign messages. Beyond campaign operations, the interface offers visibility into key metrics such as handoff rates and response sentiment analysis. When human intervention is needed, the chat interface displays complete conversation histories including AI-generated responses, enabling seamless takeover and continuity in customer interactions.

# Usage
1. **Accessing the application**:
   
   Once both backend and frontend are deployed, access the Smart Outreach Hub web interface using the `AmplifyDomainURL` from the backend stack outputs.
   ```plaintext
   https://main.<amplify-app-id>.amplifyapp.com
   ```

2. **User Registration**:
   
   Register a new user account in Amazon Cognito User Pool. You can use the AWS Management Console to do this. [Learn more about creating new user accounts in Cognito](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/how-to-create-user-accounts.html).

3. **Login**:
   
   Log in to the application using the credentials of the user account you just created.

4. **Creating a Campaign**:

   - Navigate to the **Campaigns** tab and click on **Create Campaign**.
   - Fill in the campaign details including name, message template, campaign description, and add any dynamic fields (e.g., `first_name`, `last_name`) you'd like to substitute in the message.
   - Once the campaign is created, you can upload a CSV file containing the list of prospects. A sample CSV template can be downloaded from the interface.
   - On successful upload, click the **Send Campaign** button to start sending messages to the prospects.

5. **How are user responses handled?**

   - When a prospect responds to the SMS, their message is processed by the agentic AI workflow.
   - The AI agent analyzes the message, maintains conversation context, and generates an appropriate response based on the predefined prompts and guardrails.
   - If the AI determines that the conversation requires human intervention (e.g., high purchase intent, complex queries), it flags the conversation for handoff to a sales representative.
   - After a human handoff occurs, the sales team can continue the conversation using the chat interface provided in the **Customer Responses** tab.

6. **Using the Customer Responses Interface**:
   
   - Navigate to the **Customer Responses** tab to view all conversations with the prospects.
   - The conversations are filtered into three categories:
     - **All**: View all conversations.
     - **Needs Response**: Conversations that require human intervention.
     - **Agent Responding**: Conversations currently being handled by a human agent.
     - **Automated**: Conversations being managed by the AI agent.
   - Use the search and filter options to find specific customers or conversations.
   - Click on a conversation to view the full message history, including AI-generated responses.
   - If a conversation is flagged for human intervention, you can take over by sending a message directly from the chat interface.
   - To move conversations back to AI handling, update the status to **Automated**.

7. **Autofill Meeting Link Feature**:

   - The chat interface includes an **Fill Meeting Link** button, which automatically inserts a Calendly scheduling link into the message input field.
   - This feature is designed to streamline the process of scheduling meetings with prospects, allowing sales representatives to quickly share their availability without leaving the chat interface.

# Troubleshooting

1. **CDK Bootstrap Issues**:
   
   - If you encounter errors during the `cdk bootstrap` step, ensure that your AWS CLI is configured correctly with the necessary permissions.
   - You may need to run `aws configure` again to verify your credentials.
   - Explicitly set the AWS Account ID and Region in the bootstrap command:
     ```bash
     cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNT_ID/REGION
     ```

2. **Deployment Script Errors**:

   - If you get a "Permission denied" error when running the deployment scripts, ensure that you have set the executable permissions:
     ```bash
     chmod +x ./deploy_backend.sh
     chmod +x ./deploy_frontend.sh
     ```
   - Make sure you are running the scripts in a compatible environment (e.g., WSL for Windows users).
   - Check that all [prerequisites](#prerequisites) are installed and properly configured.
   - Review the [`backend/cdk.context.json`](backend/cdk.context.json) file to ensure all required fields are filled out correctly.
   - Ensure your AWS CLI credentials have the necessary permissions to create and manage AWS resources.
   - Run the scripts from the root of the repository to ensure relative paths are correct.

3. **End users not receiving SMS messages**:

   - Ensure that your AWS End User Messaging account is out of the sandbox mode. In sandbox mode, you can only send messages to [verified destination phone numbers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox-verifying-phone-numbers.html).
   - Learn how to move Amazon SNS SMS out of the sandbox mode [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox-moving-to-production.html).
   - Verify that the origination number and phone number ID in the [`backend/cdk.context.json`](backend/cdk.context.json) file are correct and correspond to the number you requested in AWS End User Messaging.
   - Verify that the phone number you requested in AWS End User Messaging is active and capable of two-way messaging.
   - Check your AWS SNS and SQS configurations to ensure messages are being sent and received correctly.
   - Review the CloudWatch logs for the Lambda functions to identify any errors during message processing.
