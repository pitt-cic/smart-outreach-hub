extend type Mutation {
    """
    Sends a manual message from a human agent to a customer.

    This mutation is used when an agent wants to send a custom message outside
    of the automated flow. The message is marked with responseType: manual
    and direction: outbound.

    **Key behaviors:**
    - Message is sent immediately
    - Customer's status may be automatically updated to agent_responding
    - Message is added to the customer's chat history
    - Automated responses are typically suspended while agent is active

    **Example:**
    ```graphql
    mutation {
        sendManualMessage(
            phoneNumber: "+12345678900"
            message: "Thanks for your interest! I'd love to schedule a call. Are you available tomorrow at 2pm?"
        ) {
            id
            phoneNumber
            message
            direction
            responseType
            timestamp
        }
    }
    ```

    **Use case:** Agent-initiated conversations, follow-ups, customer support

    **Important:** Ensure the agent has claimed this customer (status: agent_responding)
    before sending manual messages to avoid conflicts with automated systems.
