    Creates a new outreach campaign.

    This initializes a new campaign with the provided name, message template,
    and optional details. The campaign is created in a draft state with all
    metrics initialized to zero. Use the sendCampaign mutation to actually
    dispatch messages to contacts.

    **Example:**
    ```graphql
    mutation {
        createCampaign(input: {
            name: "Q1 Product Launch"
            messageTemplate: "Hi {firstName}, we're excited to announce..."
            campaignDetails: "Targeting existing customers for new feature launch"
        }) {
            campaignId
            name
            messageTemplate
            totalContacts
            createdAt
        }
    }
    ```

    **Workflow:** Create campaign → Add contacts → Send campaign

    createCampaign(

    """
    Updates an existing campaign's details.

    Currently supports updating the campaignDetails field only.
    Cannot modify the campaign name or message template after creation
    to maintain audit integrity.

    **Example:**
    ```graphql
    mutation {
        updateCampaign(input: {
            campaignId: "camp_123456"
            campaignDetails: "Updated targeting criteria: focus on high-value customers"
        }) {
            campaignId
            campaignDetails
            updatedAt
        }
    }
    ```

    **Note:** This mutation does not affect campaign metrics or sent messages.
    """
    updateCampaign(
        """
        Input object containing campaign ID and fields to update.
        """
        input: UpdateCampaignInput!
    ): Campaign!

    """
    Sends messages to all contacts in the specified campaign.

    This mutation triggers the actual message delivery process. Messages are
    sent asynchronously, and the campaign's sentCount will increment as
    messages are successfully delivered.

    **Important considerations:**
    - Messages are sent immediately; there is no undo
    - Rate limiting is applied based on messaging provider limits
    - Campaign metrics will begin updating as responses are received

    **Example:**
    ```graphql
    mutation {
        sendCampaign(campaignId: "camp_123456") {
            campaignId
            name
            totalContacts
            sentCount
        }
    }
    ```

    **Workflow:** Create campaign → Add contacts → **Send campaign** → Monitor responses

        """
        The unique identifier of the campaign to send.
