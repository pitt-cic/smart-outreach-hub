extend type Mutation {
    """
    Deletes all data from the system including customers, campaigns, and messages.

    **⚠️ DANGER: This operation is irreversible and destructive.**

    This mutation is intended for:
    - Development and testing environments
    - Demo resets between presentations
    - Complete system cleanup during troubleshooting

    **NEVER use this in production unless you are absolutely certain.**

    Returns `true` if the operation completed successfully.

    **Example:**
    ```graphql
    mutation {
        clearAllData
    }
    ```

    **What gets deleted:**
    - All customer records and their associated data
    - All campaign records and metrics
    - All chat messages and conversation history
    - All related metadata and relationships

    **Recommended safeguards:**
    - Require additional confirmation in the UI
    - Implement environment-based restrictions
    - Add audit logging for compliance
    - Consider soft-delete patterns for production
